🎯 Description of the project:

   This is an academic activity that I did as part of the MIT Xpro Full Stack Developer Program. It consists of creating through Javascript eye movement linked to the      mouse. I added to the activity as extracurricular a design with HTML and CSS, which is minimalist and I was inspired by the famous Cookie Monster of Sesame Street. To    give it a better look I changed the mouse icon for a cookie icon. I hope you like it.
