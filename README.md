🎯 Description of the project:
This is an academic activity that I did as part of the MIT Xpro Full Stack Developer Program. It consists of creating through Javascript eye movement linked to the      mouse. I added to the activity as extracurricular a design with HTML and CSS, which is minimalist and I was inspired by the famous Cookie Monster of Sesame Street     (Created by, Jim Henson 1967). To    give it a better look I changed the mouse icon for a cookie icon. I hope you like it.

✨ How to run: Enter the Demo and move the mouse

🚀 Technologies: JavaScript, HTML, Css 

✅ Requirements: Installing Git and Copy the repository: https://github.com/ClaudiaLopezLagosGlez/Eyes-Movements.git

♻️ Roadmap of future improvements: With Css and Boostrap Implement more design to achieve the Cookie Monster . Add some paragraph describing the Cookie Monster.
